UHEAT 1.2 is our attempt to use what we learned from UHEAT 1.0 and adapt it for code that treats GEE as seperate from the PCA. 
This PCA focuses on strictly Social Vulnerabilities, with no GEE code or content factors in it. 
The final product of this PCA will then be put into ArcGIS Pro and combined with GEE data to create Bivariate Maps as analysis of the factors overlayed. 
The TidyCensus and PCA folders come with seperate README files. The biggest lessons of this code are that tract level data is preffered for PCA of Census and Health data.
